Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky,</br>
Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone,</br>
Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die,</br>
One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne</br>
In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.</br>
One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,</br>
One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them</br>
In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.</p>
